# Twitter Clone Front End
This is the front end of my [twitter clone](https://chrismenke45.github.io/twitter-client) made with React:

<br />
## How it's made:
Tech used: React.js, CSS
<br />
This was made with several custom reusable React functional components.
<br />
## Optimizations
The main optimization I'd like to make to the front end of this project is encapsulating more of my logic in functions to produce more DRY code. I would also like to make the css easier to understand/read for others, and I think I will look into using tailwind.css in the future. I also should have made use of the useReducer and useContext hooks for state management. It would have made my components take in significantly less props. I did end up using those hooks on my [instagram clone](https://github.com/chrismenke45/instagram-clone-client)
<br />
## Lessons Learned:
This was my first large fullstack project and it really taught me how to get my api and client side to interact with eachother.
